- You may want to install 3rd party UI (but you can also use Azure portal or CLI during workshop)
  - ASCII based interactive UI for keyboard-focused people: [k9s](https://k9scli.io/topics/install/)
  - GUI based for mouse-focused people: [kubelens](https://k8slens.dev/)
- Clone this repo to your computer and learn [Git basics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/gitworkflow?view=azure-devops) like clone, pull, push, commit and work with Pull requests

  - [Azure Portal intro](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/explore-azure-portal/)
  - [Azure CLI intro](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/control-azure-services-with-cli/)

## Organizer
- Get subscription ready with enough VM core quotas (B-series) -> use EA, CSP or PAYG, but NOT trial subscriptions due to low quota
- Every participant to be Owner of this subscription for siplicity (you can delete subscription after training - it is good practice have short-lived subscription just for purpose of training and then people should use your dev/sandbox environment)
- Prefer subscription in customer tenant
- Give access on Owner level to instructor one day before start so shared coponents can be prepared
- Check every participant is prepared as per previous section (especialy they can access environment) so time is not lost
